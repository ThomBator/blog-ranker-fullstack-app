## Background

Originally inspired by a simplified blogging app created as part of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course from the University of Helsinki, this project expands significantly on the original concept, incorporating more advanced features and technologies.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThomBator/blog-ranker-fullstack-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd blog-ranker-fullstack-app
npm install
```

### Database Setup

Before running the app, ensure you have a local instance of MongoDB running. You will also need to create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=3001
```

Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual local MongoDB URI, and `your_jwt_secret` with a secure secret key.

### Usage

1. Start the backend server from within ./blog-list-backend:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Start the frontend React application from within ./blog-list-frontend:

```bash
npm start



```
